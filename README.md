# Digital Ocean


DigitalOcean's web portal is a user-friendly and robust platform that empowers individuals and businesses to easily manage their cloud infrastructure. This intuitive interface serves as the gateway to DigitalOcean's comprehensive suite of cloud computing services, allowing users to deploy, scale, and monitor their applications with efficiency and precision.

Upon logging into the DigitalOcean web portal, users are greeted with a clean and organized dashboard that provides a snapshot of their resources. The portal offers seamless navigation, enabling users to swiftly access various features such as virtual machines (Droplets), storage solutions (Spaces and Volumes), networking configurations, and more.

The portal's design emphasizes simplicity without compromising functionality. Users can initiate Droplet deployments with just a few clicks, choosing from a variety of pre-configured images or customizing their setups according to specific requirements. DigitalOcean's web portal also facilitates easy scaling, allowing users to vertically adjust their resources to accommodate changing workloads.

Figma - [Digital Ocean](https://www.figma.com/file/mFZXp9lLt7uXbfPkAnhDxH/Digital-Ocean-Partner-Showcase?type=design&t=kBtFVXJBY1MjoBzm-6)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `[[git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git](https://github.com/veer1996chand/Digital Ocean)](https://github.com/veer1996chand/digital-ocean)`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd digital-ocean`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`

   
### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Build
To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build

```
Project Structure
We have the main folder Digital Ocean and we developed this project using [`Atomic design`]([https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#:~:text=Molecules%20are%20groups%20of%20two,functioning%20together%20as%20a%20unit.]) in the Next js with Typescript. our main important directory is SRC where we placed all the components and pages.
